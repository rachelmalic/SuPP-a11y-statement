accessibilityProblems:  
- some error messages are not descriptive enough for people with visual impairments – but are compatible with common assistive technology tools
- some headings are not consistent
- elements which are missing their labels – using a screen reader to read back the entire page will provide all the information needed
milestones: 
- description: The X page does not have Y and also does not display Z. This doesn't meet WCAG success criterion X.Y.Z (Criterion Description).

    -  This service uses radio buttons which are grouped so that the page can be navigated with only the keyboard. In some places, these groups are missing their labels which means screen reading software will not read out the description of the selected element. This does not meet WCAG success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).We plan to add the correct labels and field sets to all of our radio buttons by 15 December 2021.
    -  We use tab titles to describe the content of our web pages. In some places, the tab titles do not match the heading of the page. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).We plan to add consistent titles and headings for all the pages in the service by 15 December 2021.
    -  Some error messages are not descriptive enough for people with visual impairments. This does not meet WCAG Success Criterion 3.3.3 (Error Suggestion)
